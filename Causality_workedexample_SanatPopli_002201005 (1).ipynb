    "Introduction to Graphical Models for Causality:\n",
    "The guide initiates by establishing the Python environment essential for data analytics, incorporating libraries such as pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, and graphviz.\n",
    "For visual representation of causal links, graphviz is utilized to craft directed graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    "About Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2 From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).\n",

    "Pregnancies: To express the Number of pregnancies\n",
    "\n",
    "Glucose: To express the Glucose level in blood\n",
    "\n",
    "BloodPressure: To express the Blood pressure measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin\n",
    "\n",
    "Insulin: To express the Insulin level in blood\n",

    "This code snippet is setting up a Python environment for data analysis and visualization, particularly using the pandas, numpy, graphviz, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries. Each line or block of code has a specific function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import warnings` and `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')`: These lines import the warnings library and suppress all warnings. This is often done in notebooks to make the output cleaner by not displaying warning messages that can arise from deprecated features or other non-critical issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `import pandas as pd`: Imports the pandas library and aliases it as `pd`. Pandas is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `import numpy as np`: Imports the numpy library and aliases it as `np`. NumPy is fundamental for scientific computing with Python, offering comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `import graphviz as gr`: Imports the graphviz library and aliases it as `gr`. Graphviz is a tool for creating visual representations of graphs (not the chart kind but the nodes-and-edges kind).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `from matplotlib import style` and `import seaborn as sns`: These lines import the style module from matplotlib and the seaborn library as `sns`. Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `from matplotlib import pyplot as plt`: Imports the pyplot module from matplotlib and aliases it as `plt`. This is used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The next few lines define lists for `color`, `linestyle`, and `marker`:\n",
    "   - `color=['0.3', '0.5', '0.7', '0.9']`: Defines a list of grayscale values to be used in plots.\n",
    "   - `linestyle=['-', '--', ':', '-.']`: Defines a list of line styles for plotting.\n",
    "   - `marker=['o', 'v', 'd', 'p']`: Defines a list of marker styles for plotting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 6)`: This pandas function sets the option to display a maximum of 6 rows when outputting a DataFrame to the console, making it easier to view large DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `gr.set_default_format(\"png\")`: This sets the default format for graphviz outputs to be PNG. This is useful for ensuring that the visualizations generated by graphviz are in a widely supported and easily shareable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code snippet is a preparatory step typically found at the beginning of data analysis and visualization"

    "This code snippet is creating a directed graph using the `graphviz` library to visualize relationships or flows between different entities or nodes. Specifically, it's setting up a graph to illustrate factors that might influence \"conversion\" in a context that suggests cross-selling via email. Let's break down the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import graphviz as gr`: This line imports the `graphviz` library and aliases it as `gr`. `graphviz` is a package that facilitates the creation and rendering of graph descriptions in the DOT language of the Graphviz graph drawing software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `graph_cross_sell = gr.Digraph()`: Initializes a new directed graph object called `graph_cross_sell`. A directed graph is a set of nodes connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `graph_cross_sell.edge(\"U\", \"conversion\")`: Adds an edge to the graph from node \"U\" to node \"conversion\". This implies that \"U\" influences or has a relationship leading towards \"conversion\". The specific nature of \"U\" isn't defined in this snippet, but it could represent a unique factor or variable in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `graph_cross_sell.edge(\"U\", \"age\")` and `graph_cross_sell.edge(\"U\", \"gender\")`: Similar to the previous step, these lines add edges from \"U\" to \"age\" and \"gender\", respectively, indicating that \"U\" might influence or determine these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `graph_cross_sell.edge(\"rnd\", \"cross_sell_email\")`: Adds an edge from \"rnd\" to \"cross_sell_email\", suggesting that \"rnd\" (possibly randomization or a random factor) influences the cross-sell email. This could indicate that the assignment of cross-sell emails is randomized in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `graph_cross_sell.edge(\"cross_sell_email\", \"conversion\")`: This line shows that the cross-sell email has a direct influence on conversion, which is likely the ultimate goal of this analysisâ€”to understand how cross-sell emails affect conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `graph_cross_sell.edge(\"age\", \"conversion\")` and `graph_cross_sell.edge(\"gender\", \"conversion\")`: These lines indicate that both \"age\" and \"gender\" directly influence \"conversion\". This suggests that the analysis is considering how different age groups and genders respond to the cross-selling strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `graph_cross_sell`: This line simply references the `graph_cross_sell` object. In an interactive Python environment like Jupyter notebooks, this would display the graph. The graph visualizes the relationships between the various entities: \"U\", \"age\", \"gender\", \"rnd\", \"cross_sell_email\", and \"conversion\", showing the direct and indirect influences on conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code uses `graphviz` to model the relationships between different factors involved in a cross-selling scenario, highlighting how various elements might contribute to the conversion process."

    "Create the directed graph: I create a directed graph named model using nx.DiGraph(). This graph is initialized with a list of tuples, each representing an edge from one node to another. The tuples specify the relationships between the nodes, such as Pregnancy leading to Glucose, Glucose leading to Insulin, and so on.\n",
    "Define the relationships:\n",
    "Pregnancy influences Glucose levels.\n",
    "Glucose levels influence both Insulin production and the Outcome directly.\n",
    "Insulin levels influence Blood Pressure.\n",
    "Blood Pressure influences BMI (Body Mass Index).\n",
    "BMI influences the Diabetes Pedigree Function, which is a function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.\n",
    "Additionally, Glucose influences the Diabetes Pedigree Function and directly impacts the Outcome, indicating its central role in the development of diabetes.\n"

    "Are Pregnancy and Insulin dependent?\n",
    "This query checks if there is a dependency between Pregnancy and Insulin without considering any other variables. Given the graph structure, where Pregnancy influences Glucose, which in turn influences Insulin, there's an indirect path from Pregnancy to Insulin. This indicates that, in the absence of conditioning on any intermediary variable (like Glucose), Pregnancy and Insulin are dependent because information about Pregnancy can affect the prediction about Insulin levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are Pregnancy and Glucose dependent given Insulin?\n",
    "This second query asks whether Pregnancy and Glucose remain dependent when the model is conditioned on Insulin. Since Insulin is downstream of Glucose, conditioning on Insulin might block some of the information flow from Glucose to Insulin, potentially altering the dependency relationship between Pregnancy and Glucose. However, the direct influence from Pregnancy to Glucose does not pass through Insulin, so Pregnancy and Glucose should still be considered dependent, even when considering Insulin. The conditioning on Insulin is more relevant to the path that goes through it and less to the direct influence of Pregnancy on Glucose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the understanding of the model's structure and the principles of d-separation, these interpretations suggest that Pregnancy and Insulin are dependent due to their positions in the network and the paths that connect them. For the second case, Pregnancy and Glucose's dependence is direct and is not impacted by conditioning on Insulin, given the nature of the graph and the paths defined within it."

    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The inquiries made using NetworkX's d_separated function provide insightful analyses into the conditional dependencies within a model of health indicators related to diabetes. These dependencies reveal the complex interplay between various physiological factors and their collective influence on diabetes outcomes. Here's a summary of the findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency Between Glucose and Pregnancy: It was confirmed that Glucose and Pregnancy are dependent variables within the model. This relationship underscores the critical role of pregnancy in influencing glucose levels, a key factor in gestational diabetes and its management.\n",
    "Dependency of Insulin and Glucose Given Pregnancy: Insulin and Glucose were found to be dependent when conditioned on Pregnancy, illustrating how pregnancy can influence the relationship between glucose production and insulin secretion, highlighting the interconnectedness of these factors during pregnancy.\n",
    "Dependency of Insulin and Glucose Given Outcome: The analysis also explored how the relationship between Insulin and Glucose changes when conditioned on the Outcome (i.e., diabetes presence or absence). This reflects the nuanced ways in which outcomes can be influenced by, and also influence, the interplay between glucose and insulin levels.\n",
    "Outcome and Insulin Dependency: The dependency between Outcome and Insulin without conditioning on any other variable was explored. This reflects on the direct or indirect pathways through which insulin levels can influence diabetes outcomes, emphasizing insulin's pivotal role in diabetes management and outcome.\n",
    "Outcome and Insulin Dependency Given Glucose: Conditioning on Glucose, the dependency between Outcome and Insulin was further examined. This analysis helps in understanding how glucose levels, a fundamental factor in diabetes, mediate the relationship between insulin function and diabetes outcomes.\n",
    "Pregnancy and Insulin Dependency: The inquiry into whether Pregnancy and Insulin are dependent variables without conditioning shows the indirect relationships in the model, highlighting the broader physiological effects of pregnancy that may impact insulin's role in the body.\n",
    "Pregnancy and Glucose Dependency Given Insulin: Finally, exploring the dependency of Pregnancy and Glucose when conditioned on Insulin sheds light on the intricate balance between these factors and their combined effect on diabetes risk and management.\n",
    "Overall, these analyses offer a window into the sophisticated dynamics governing the relationships between key factors involved in diabetes. By understanding these dependencies, both conditioned and unconditioned, researchers and healthcare professionals can better grasp the multifaceted nature of diabetes, leading to more effective prevention, management, and treatment strategies. The model's insights into how variables such as Pregnancy, Glucose, Insulin, and Outcome interact with each other are crucial for tailoring interventions and understanding the disease's progression and management in different individuals."
