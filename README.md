This git repository is exclusively for cloning my DATA ENGINEERING METHODS AND TOOLS assignment


In this repository I have put all my work related to datascience in which I have done work on 4 major parts of data science and machine learning and that are as folllows
-Feature extraction and selection
-AutoML
-Model Interpretability
-Neural Network

In the end I have created a minor project including all these above machine learning tools and created a diabetes prediction model.
The details of this project are as follows-

-Data Cleaning and Preparation
Conducted thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers, enhancing the quality and reliability of the dataset.
Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
-Feature Selection and Analysis
Applied techniques like correlation analysis and principal component analysis to identify the most relevant features for predicting diabetes.
Demonstrated a keen understanding of feature relevance to the target variable, enhancing model accuracy and efficiency.
-Model Development and Evaluation
Built and compared multiple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, SVM) to determine the most effective approach for diabetes prediction.
Tuned model parameters using methods like grid search to optimize performance, achieving a [specific metric, e.g., 95% accuracy].
-Interpretability and Insights
Employed interpretability tools like SHAP or feature importance analysis to provide insights into model predictions, ensuring transparent and explainable results.
Derived actionable insights from the model, contributing to a deeper understanding of key factors influencing diabetes.
-Communication and Reporting
Crafted a comprehensive report detailing the projectâ€™s methodology, findings, and implications, demonstrating strong data storytelling skills.
Effectively communicated complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making.-Data Cleaning and Preparat
